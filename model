In 2021, the pioneering work TypeNet showed that keystroke dynamics verification could scale to hundreds of thousands of users with minimal performance degradation. Recently, the KVC-onGoing competition has provided an open and robust experimental protocol 
for evaluating keystroke dynamics verification systems of such scale. %, including considerations of algorithmic fairness. This article describes Type2Branch, the model and techniques that achieved the lowest error rates at the KVC-onGoing, 
in both desktop and mobile typing scenarios. The novelty aspects of the proposed Type2Branch include: i) synthesized timing features emphasizing user behavior deviation from the general population, ii) a dual-branch architecture combining recurrent 
and convolutional paths with various attention mechanisms, iii) a new loss function named Set2set that captures the global structure of the embedding space, and iv) a training curriculum of increasing difficulty. Considering five enrollment samples per subject 
of approximately 50 characters typed, the proposed Type2Branch achieves state-of-the-art performance with mean per-subject Equal Error Rates (EERs) of 0.77% and 1.03% on evaluation sets of respectively 15,000 and 5,000 subjects for desktop and mobile scenarios. 
With a fixed global threshold for all subjects, the EERs are respectively 3.25% and 3.61% for desktop and mobile scenarios, outperforming previous approaches by a significant margin. The source code for dataset generation, model, and training process is publicly available.
